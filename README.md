# MyTeamFinder

This is one of my biggest university projects written in PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript (without any frameworks)

This project is a Web Application for players of e-sport games and normal sports. User of this application has the ability of finding other players interested in playing a game he organises.
The user can post an event (Football match, Online game etc.) which is displayed on the main page. Other users can join this event. This application is aimed at players that don't have enough company for the game they like to play.

* PostgreSQL

Frontend:
* HTML5
* CSS - with SASS preprocessor
* Javascript - for validating forms and displaying some of the page elements
